SAILOR: Snakemake And slurm analysIs of Large isolate cOllections using piRate

# Goal
If you run PIRATE on systems using a SLURM scheduler, your jobs may run out of time, especially when aligning larger collections. I have had some issues running PIRATE core/pan genome alignment for >2500 *E. coli* isolates, so I needed a workflow to handle this efficiently on SLURM systems.

# Methods
TBD

# Etymology
The SAILOR acronym was generated using [ACRONYM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.12180). Because the possibilities are endless with ACRONYM, I chose a name related to the software central to this workflow, PIRATE.
